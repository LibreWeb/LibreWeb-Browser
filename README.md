# LibreWeb Browser

LibreWeb is an **open-source decentralized web browser**, leveraging IPFS. What would you do different; if you could **reinvent** The Internet in 21st century?  
With all the knowledge and new technologies available today. I was inspired by Douglas Engelbart, Tim Berners-Lee and Ted Nelson as well as projects like IPFS, Jekyll, ARPANET and more.

### Ideas / Features

The current success criteria:

* Everyone should be able to easily **read** and **create** a site/blog/news page and publish the content online (without minimal technical knowledge);
* Built-in easy-to-use **editor** (whenever you want to publish some content without programming language knowledge);
* **Decentralized** (no single-point of failure or censorship), like: P2P, DHT and IPFS;
* *No* client-server approach (the client is also the server and visa versa) - think **mesh network**.
* **Encrypted** transfers;
* Data is stored **redundantly** within the network (no single-point of failure);
* **Versioning**/revisions of content and documenents (automatically solves broken 'links', that can't happy anymore);
* Publisher user should be able to add additional information about the document/page, eg. title or path (similar in how Jekyll is using the `YML` format for meta data)
* Human-readable source-code (eg. `Markdown` format, could be extended as well);
* You are in control about the layout and styling (just like with e-books);
* Content is King;
* Fast and Extensible!

*Note:* Since HyperText (so is HTML) is not used, you can even ditch the HTTP protocol. However TLS, for encryption, can still be used.

The sections below are mainly relevant for software developers, who want to contribute or help the LibreWeb Browser project.

## For Developers

Decentralized Browser is written C++ together with some [external libraries](/lib). LibreWeb is using the [cmark-gfm](https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm) library for example, which is used for CommonMark (markdown) parsing.  
We're using markdown as the source-code of the content/site. No HTML and JavaScript anymore, content is king after all.

LibreWeb Browser is also using [Gnome GTK3](https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/) framework for the GUI. Using the C++ bindings, called [Gtkmm](https://gtkmm.org/en/).

### Development Environment

Personally, I'm using VSCodium editor, with the following extensions installed: `C/C++`, `CMake`, `CMake Tools`, `PlantUML`, `Markdown All in One`, `vscode-icons` and `GitLab Workflow`. But your local development setup is completely up to you.

### Linux Build Dependencies

For the **GNU/Linux build** you need at least:

* GCC 9 or higher (Packages: `build-essential g++-9`)
* CMake (Package: `cmake`)
* Ninja build system (Package: `ninja-build`)
* Libcurl (Package: `libcurl4-openssl-dev`)
* GTK3/Gtkmm3 (Package: `libgtkmm-3.0-dev`)

**Dependencies for testing:**

* X virtual framebuffer (Package: `xvfb`)
* Clang-format (Package: `clang-format`)

*Note:* For cross-compiling towards Windows and building on macOS see "[Other platforms](#other-platforms)" section below.

### Linux Build

Clone the source-code with SSH (do not forget `--recurse-submodules`):

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules -j5 git@gitlab.melroy.org:libreweb/browser.git
```

Start the Linux build, which is using CMake and Ninja build system, using the wrapper script:

```sh
./scripts/build-lnx.sh
```

Optionally, use the VSCode `CMake Tools` extension to start the build or build with debug targets.

#### Linux Packaging

*Note:* Linux packages are already [available under releases](https://gitlab.melroy.org/libreweb/browser/-/releases).

To build a release target yourself including packaging under GNU/Linux, use: `./scripts/build-lnx-prod.sh`

Root access is required when building Linux packages; add `/opt/mxe/usr/bin` to the secure_path using: `sudo visudo`.

### Unit testing (Linux)

To execute the **unit tests** you can configure with `cmake -DUNITTEST:BOOL=TRUE` and build. Execute: `ctest` command in the `tst` target directory.

Or just use script:

```sh
./scripts/build-run-tests.sh
```

### C++ Coding Style Guidelines

#### Automated Clang Format

We use our [own Clang LLVM C++ Programming Style Format](.clang-format), using [clang-format](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html) command.

To automatically comply to our style format execute following script (inplace edits are performed for you):

```sh
./scripts/fix-format.sh
```

Check only for errors, run: `./scripts/check-format.sh`

#### Core Guidelines

We also tend to follow the popular [C++ Core Guidelines](http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines) as much as possible.

### Doxygen

See latest [Developer Documentation](https://gitlab.melroy.org/libreweb/browser/-/jobs/artifacts/master/file/build_docs/docs/html/index.html?job=doxygen).

Doxygen is build by default. You can disable the doxygen build, if you want, using: `cmake -DDOXYGEN:BOOL=FALSE ..`

### Memory Leaks

First **build** the (Linux) target including *debug symbols*. Binary should be present in the `build/src` folder.

Next, check for memory leaks using `valgrind` by executing:

```sh
./scripts/valgrind.sh
```

## Other platforms

### Microsoft Windows

We are [**cross-compiling**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_compiler) towards **Windows** using GNU/Linux.

#### Windows Build Dependencies

* [MXE Gtkmm3 / Curl Binary packages](mxe.cc) (static build using Meson build with GCC11, see below for more info)
* CMake (Package: `cmake`)
* Ninja (Package: `ninja-build`)
* Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (Package: `nsis`)

For more information and the latest pre-build GTK3 Windows download, please my other [GTK 3 bundle repo](https://gitlab.melroy.org/melroy/gtk-3-bundle-for-windows).

**Note:** We're currently busy trying to upgrade the [whole GTK stack](https://github.com/danger89/mxe/tree/update_gtk).

We used the following build command to get the Windows dependencies and MXE cross-compilation toolset:

```sh
make gtkmm3 curl -j 16 MXE_TARGETS='x86_64-w64-mingw32.static' MXE_PLUGIN_DIRS='plugins/gcc10'
```

*NOTE:* Soon we need gcc11, but GTK3 upstream needs to create a new release that fixes the GCC11 builds.

Add the following line to the end of the `~/.bashrc` file:

```bash
export PATH="/opt/mxe/usr/bin:$PATH"
```

#### Windows Cross-compile Build

Please, be sure you meet all the requirements above. So your MXE environment should be ready in: `/opt/mxe/usr`.

To start the *cross-compile* build towards Windows 64-bit (using GNU/Linux as host) you can use the commands below.

Build a Windows development release:

```sh
./scripts/build-win.sh
```

#### Windows Packaging

*Note:* Windows Installer is already [available under releases](https://gitlab.melroy.org/libreweb/browser/-/releases).

Build a production release + packaging with [NSIS Installer](https://sourceforge.net/projects/nsis/), execute the following:

```sh
./scripts/build-win-prod.sh
```

For more info, see also: [Windows readme file](windows.md).

### Apple MacOS / Darwin

#### MacOS Build Dependencies

* Xcode (`xcode-select --install`)
* Brew (`/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"`)
* CMake (brew: `cmake`)
* Libcurl (brew: `curl`)
* Gtk3/Gtkmm3 (brew: `gtkmm3`)
* GTK Mac Integration (brew: `gtk-mac-integration`)
* Ninja (brew: `ninja`)

#### MacOS Build

We're currently using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/LibreWeb/Browser/blob/master/.github/workflows/macOS-build.yml) for the [macOS build](https://github.com/LibreWeb/Browser/actions/workflows/macOS-build.yml). You could already download the artifact if you want, but do not expect the runtime to work.

*Note:* **Packaging towards MacOS is still in progress**.
