# Welcome to the Decentralized Web

## Intro

LibreWeb Browser is a **decentralized browser**, using the IPFS protocol. But it's not limited by the use of that protocol.

You can write your new *blog post* or *book* on the web 3.0, using LibreWeb. Fully written in markdown syntax.

## Why?

1. It's fully decentralized
2. It's censorship resistance
3. Mark is easy to learn and use
4. It's very fast and safe! No bloat, no JavaScript, no pop-ups, no ads!

```python
print ("Hello world")
```
I'm currently using this browser under ==GNU/Linux== and Windows is also supported! Soon macOS package will be made available.
