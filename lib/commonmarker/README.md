# CommonMarker / Cmark Parser

We are using [cmark-gfm](https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm) as our common marker parser.

However, we create a source code copy in your own `/src` and `/extensions` directories.

We created our own **additional extensions** in the [extensions](./extensions) folder as well! Like our *highlight*, *sub-*and *superscript* extensions.

The [cmark-gfm](./cmark-gfm) folder is the upstream folder.
