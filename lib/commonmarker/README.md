# Common Marker

We are using [cmark-gfm](https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm) as the common marker parser and rendering libary. However, we create a source code copy in your own /src and /extensions directories.

We create additional extensions in the [extensions](./extensions) folder.

The [cmark-gfm](./cmark-gfm) folder is the upstream folder.
